### Description

Ever find yourself in projects that use color designs and unable to communicate or evoke the idea behind a certain color? Why not keep track and update your personal definitions of any color? 

I believe that every color can mean countless things for each person. It is a relative idea, color. Thus there seems to be a gap between color intentions and the color of choice. Take the following example.

 > In business, being "in the red" means being unprofitable. Yet, we can think about sports cars in the color red, which signifies success or power (among other things). What gives?

The goal of this app is to close in the gap between one person's ideas behind a color and how that person can think about colors with clearer concepts that will help him/her manage their own select palette of color definitions, for different contexts.
